//! The orchestrator of a futarchy. Equivalent to the 'governor' of Compound's
//! governance system.
//!
//! Autocrat has two types of accounts: DAOs and proposals. Every DAO has its
//! own token, its own treasury account, and list of configs. Proposals are
//! created for a specific DAO, and contain an SVM instruction and a URL that
//! should point to a description and justification of that instruction.
//!
//! Proposals pass through various states in their lifecycle. Here's a description
//! of these states:
//! - Pre-creation: this is when you initialize the accounts needed for a proposal,
//!   including the vaults and the AMM accounts. The proposer will also deposit to
//!   create their LP during this time.
//! - Trading: to create a proposal, the proposer must call
//!   `initialize_proposal`, which requires them to lock up some LP tokens in each
//!   of the markets. Once a proposal is created, anyone can trade its markets.
//!   Prices of these markets are aggregated into a time-weighted average price
//!   oracle.
//! - Pass or fail: if the TWAP of the pass market is sufficiently higher than the
//!   TWAP of the fail market, the proposal will pass. If it's not, the proposal will
//!   fail. If it passes, both vaults will be finalized, allowing pTOKEN holders to
//!   redeem. If it fails, both vaults will be reverted, allowing fTOKEN holders to
//!   redeem.
//! - Executed: if a proposal passes, anyone can make autocrat execute its SVM
//!   instruction by calling `execute_proposal`.
